# Description

Craftologia is a pack that focuses on making more realistic and challenging crafting recipes, with a carefully selected list of mods, these custom recipes further increase the relationships between them, giving items much more uses outside their own mods scope that otherwise would become useless once you complete them. 
The idea of this pack is giving the player a feeling of realism and progression with each crafting, ensuring at the same time a very long gameplay experience in order to explore what this pack provides. The pack is also meant for people who love building, decoration and exploration.

# Features
-149 mods.

-Over 2100 recipe changes (with CraftTweaker).

-35 new custom items and 3 new custom blocks (with ContentTweaker).

-Biome and dimension based oregen with larger but less common ore chunks.

-1 hour day-cycle and 28 days per season, which affects crop fertility.

-Oredict script that tries to standarize and reduce to one item per part most of the redundant metals/materials added by mods whenever its possible. This script took me quite some time, and, even though its not perfect, its much better than nothing. 

-Questbook (WIP), which includes 49 quests and 30 challenges so far.

-Guidebook that offers you some commentary about the modpack, tips and changes that you may need to know at some point during your adventure. This is not a questbook. Over time the book 
may include new content and updates, so dont throw it away.

-85 chemical elements of the Periodic Table are present in this modpack, all rows except the seventh one are mostly covered, if you like chemistry and physics this is your modpack.
