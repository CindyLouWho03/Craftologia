# Description

Craftologia is a modpack that tries to offer a more realistic and challenging concept of crafting and world mechanics. A single mod, by itself, is pretty much limited when it comes to create its own crafting recipes. However, when combined with other related mods, then the possibilities are exponentially increased. This modpack offers you a carefully selected list of mods that combine very well each other, each mod is directly or indirectly related with the rest, no mod was included just for the sake of adding more content for no reason. Even though there is no quest book or advancements system, you will have to cover most of the mods in order to "complete" the modpack. Tech, in many ways, is the dominant part of this modpack, followed by decoration and exploration, with the latter beign an important part of your journey, specially at early game and endgame.  

One year of work has been put by me to create this modpack and i hope it encourages you to explore the world, optimize your time and resources, research what each mod provides, explore the different alternatives with its advantages and disadvantages and investigate how things are done based on real data. 

# Features
-150 mods (172 by Forge Loader).

-Over 1740 recipe changes (with CraftTweaker).

-40 new custom items and 5 new custom blocks mostly created (with ContentTweaker) to cover the lack of ingredients of some recipes.

-Biome and dimension based oregen with larger but less common ore chunks.

-1 hour day-cycle and 28 days per season, which affects crop fertility.

-Oredict script that tries to standarize and reduce to one item per part most of the redundant metals/materials added by mods whenever its possible. This script took me quite some time, and, even though its not perfect, its much better than nothing. 

-Guidebook that offers you some commentary about the modpack, tips and changes that you may need to know at some point during your adventure. This is not a questbook. Over time the book 
may include new content and updates, so dont throw it away.

-74 chemical elements of the Periodic Table are present in this modpack, all rows except the seventh one are mostly covered, if you like chemistry and physics this is your modpack. May include more in the future.
